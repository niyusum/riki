# Summary for Documentation

## What We Fixed and Updated

### 🎯 Major System Change: Gacha Progression Model

**Changed from discrete brackets to progressive tier unlocks** (industry-standard model)

#### OLD System (Bracket-Based):
- Players could ONLY summon from their current level bracket
- Level 15 player: Can summon T3-4 ONLY
- Level 40 player: Can summon T8-10 ONLY
- **Problem:** Lost access to lower tiers when leveling up

#### NEW System (Progressive Unlocks):
- Players maintain access to ALL unlocked tiers
- Level 15 player: Can summon T1-4 with dynamic rates
- Level 40 player: Can summon T1-10 with exponential decay
- **Benefit:** Leveling always unlocks more, never removes content

## 🔑 Key System Updates

### Gacha Rate Progression
**Progressive Tier Unlocks** - Industry standard model (Genshin Impact / Fate/GO / Arknights)
- Dynamic rate distribution using exponential decay
- Formula: `rate[tier] = base_rate × (decay_factor ^ distance_from_newest)`
- Tunable via `decay_factor` (0.65) and `highest_tier_base` (15.0%)

### Shard System
- **Variable rewards:** 1-12 random shards per fusion failure (not fixed 1)
- **Higher redemption cost:** 100 shards required (not 10)
- **Separate pools:** Each tier has its own shard pool

### Pity System
- **25 summons** triggers guaranteed pity (not 90)
- **Option D with Tier Progression:**
  - Guarantees unowned maiden from unlocked tiers
  - Falls back to next tier up if all unlocked tiers owned
  - Example: Level 40 owns all T1-10 → pity gives T11

### Daily Quest System
- **5 daily objectives** for core engagement loop
- **XP rewards added** to Rikis, Grace, Gems
- **Streak bonuses** for consecutive day completions
- **Renamed** from quest_service to daily_service

## 📊 Rate Distribution Examples

### Level Progression
| Level | Unlocked Tiers | Highest Tier Rate | Lowest Tier Rate |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 5     | 1-3            | T3: 50%           | T1: 15%          |
| 15    | 1-4            | T4: 38%           | T1: 11%          |
| 40    | 1-10           | T10: 19%          | T1: 0.4%         |
| 50    | 1-12           | T12: 17%          | T1: 0.15%        |

### Why This Works
- ✅ Leveling always feels rewarding (unlock more, never lose)
- ✅ Lower tiers become collectibles (prestige hunting)
- ✅ Can complete all collections at any level
- ✅ Natural difficulty curve (higher tiers harder)
- ✅ Industry-proven retention mechanics

## 🗄️ Database Changes

### Required Migration
```sql

CREATE TABLE tutorial_progress (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    player_id BIGINT NOT NULL UNIQUE REFERENCES players(discord_id),
    steps_completed JSONB NOT NULL,
    rewards_claimed JSONB NOT NULL,
    started_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    completed_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX ix_tutorial_progress_player_id ON tutorial_progress(player_id);
```

### No Changes Needed
- Player model already has `pity_counter` field
- Daily quest model already exists
- Maiden/MaidenBase models unchanged

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

### Before (Bracket System)
> "Players can only summon within their level bracket, but fusion lets them push beyond."

**Problem:** Punishes leveling by removing access to content.

### After (Progressive System)
> "Players unlock higher tiers with good rates as they level, while lower tiers become collectibles. Fusion provides guaranteed progression beyond RNG."

**Benefits:** 
- Leveling is always positive
- Collection completion possible
- Natural rarity curve
- Matches industry standards
